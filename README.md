# RateMyUH
The chrome extension shows RateMyProfessors.com rating on University of Houston's class enrollment page.

This extension removes the need to go back and forth between the enrollment page and RateMyProfessors.com. It displays the professor's rating right next to the class listing.

NOTE: RateMyProfessors.com does not allow using their data for extensions like this and therefore this extension is not published. Also I stopped updating this project about a year ago for the same reason.
